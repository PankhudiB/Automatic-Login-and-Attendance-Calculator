# Automatic-Login-and-Attendance-Calculator
Moodle is our college website for students and teachers. Students can check syllabus,attendance,assignments through moodle.

A Java Application is built to automatically login to moodle and calculate and display attendance. It also gives an alert to the user if his/her attendance is less than 80%.
